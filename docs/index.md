## What Is Bruce?

Bruce is meant to be a versatile ESP32 firmware that supports a ton of offensive features focusing to facilitate on Red Team operations. It also supports products from various manufacturers like M5Stack (Cardputer and Sticks) and Lilygo (T-Embed and T-LoRa Pager).

## What Is Bruce For?

Bruce stems from a keen observation within the community focused on devices like Flipper Zero. While these devices offered a glimpse into the world of offensive security, there was a palpable sense that something more could be achieved without being that overpriced, particularly with the robust and modular hardware ecosystem provided by M5Stack and Lilygo products.
