Bruce also accept command inputs via serial port after https://github.com/BruceDevices/firmware/pull/84.

List of supported commands:
```
ir, subghz, music_player, say, led, power, clock, screen, color, tone, gpio, i2c, storage, settings, factory_reset, badusb, js, crypto, uptime, date, free, info, webui, loader
```

Most of these commands are compatible with the [Flipper Zero CLI](https://docs.flipper.net/development/cli#0Z9fs).


# How to send commands

- via the [Arduino IDE Serial Monitor](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-serial-monitor/), [Putty](https://pbxbook.com/voip/sputty.html), or any other serial terminal app
- via the terminal/a bash script: `echo "say My name is Bruce" | busybox microcom -s 115200 /dev/ttyACM0  -t 1000`
- via a [python script](https://github.com/wh00hw/pyFlipper)
- from a smartphone using [SerialManager](https://github.com/delletenebre/SerialManager2) or [Serial USB Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_usb_terminal)
- via the [WebUI](https://github.com/BruceDevices/firmware/wiki/Others#webui) ["SerialCmd" button](https://github.com/BruceDevices/firmware/pull/134)
- after starting the WebUI, with `curl -XPOST "http://bruce.local/cm" -d "cmnd=say My name is Bruce"`

Serial connection settings:

 - Speed: 115200
 - 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, no Flow Control
