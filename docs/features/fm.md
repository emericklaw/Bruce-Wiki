## Supported Modules

It needs to a Si4713. Those modules are supported and known to work:

1. [Adafruit Si4713](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1958)
2. [CJMCU-4713](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCKYlfz)


## Audio Input

Currently, the audio is transmitted via the P3 cable (3.5mm jack), it is necessary for an external device connected to the P3 cable to send the audio to the FM Transmitter.

An example would be using a phone with a P3 - P3 cable, connected to the transmitter and playing some music on the phone.


## Wiring

### Pins

| Si4713 | M5StickC | Cardputer |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------- |
| RST | ATTENTION | ATTENTION |
| SCL | Grove G33 | Grove G1 |
| SDA | Grove G32 | Grove G2 |
| GND | Grove G | Grove G |
| VIN | Grove 5V | Grove 5V |

> ATTENTION: It is necessary to turn on the device (StickC/Cardputer), place 1 wire on the RST pin of the FM Transmitter and quickly touch the end of the wire to GND to activate the RST, this way it is not necessary to use the SD Card Sniffer or the G0 pin of StickC.
>
> It is also possible to place a button or resistor for this operation, if you prefer.
