## BadUSB

Only DuckyScript payloads are supported!! for more info on creating your own DuckyScripts [read here](https://docs.hak5.org/hak5-usb-rubber-ducky/ducky-script-basics/hello-world)

To choose a payload for the BadUSB on Cardputer instead of getting rickrolled, you need to create a file on the SD card root directory ending with ".txt".
You can then select which payload that will be sent when the Cardputer is connected via USB cable.

Other methods to run badusb scripts:

1. via the SDCard/LittleFS file manager in the "Others" menu (select a `.txt` file)
2. remotely via the WebUI, click on the [antenna-like button next to the file](https://github.com/BruceDevices/firmware/pull/124)
3. via a [serial cmd](https://github.com/BruceDevices/firmware/wiki/Serial) like `badusb run_from_file HelloWorld.txt`

### Using Bad USB on StickCs and Core/Core2 devices
You will need to use a CH9329 module such as [this ](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005006680094576.html) or [this ](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005007031564072.html) to run the Bad USB in your device, wiring it into the Grove connector like this:

## Openhaystack
This is a little more complex to setup but basically you can use [this repository](https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/FindMyFlipper) to generate a AirTag public key encoded in base64.
Then to work for Bruce, you should get your Public key decoded with base64 and save it on a file on the SD root called "pub.key".
To create pub.key file you should run this in bash:
```sh
base64 -d <<< "your_base64_public_key"|tee pub.key
```
